        <p class="lead mb-0">Quim originally hails from Seoul, Korea, but currently resides in Toronto, Canada. He found his way into Toronto’s party scene back in 2002 when he started off as a promoter and then moved to deejaying around 2007.</p>

		<p class="lead mb-0">He transitioned from mainstream parties to the underground, “after hours” scene shortly after in 2008 and has gone on to become a staple in Toronto’s EDM community. Quim became a resident DJ at Comfort Zone back in 2010.</p>

		<p class="lead mb-0">He’s currently working on creating his own personal sound in addition to branding his name for producing, networking and event purposes. Be on the lookout for Quim as he’s quickly taking over Toronto, one track at a time.</p>
